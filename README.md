## Abstract

This study investigates the causal effect of Quebecâ€™s 2017 corporate income tax reduction on firm-level investment by applying a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) strategy on aggregate non-residential investment data from statistic canada. Using British Columbia as the control group, we compare trends in non-residential investment across the manufacturing and finance industries. The findings support the traditional economic view that tax cuts can boost investment, particularly in capital-intensive sectors like manufacturing.

## Research Questions

1. **Does corporate income tax affect investment levels in Canada?**  
2. **Do the effects vary by industryâ€”specifically between manufacturing and finance?**

---

## Methodology

- **Design:** Quasi-experimental DiD model (2009â€“2023)
- **Treatment Group:** Quebec (post-2017 tax cuts)
- **Control Group:** British Columbia (no significant tax change)
- **Data Source:** Statistics Canada â€“ Table 34-10-0035-01
- **Outcome Variable:** Non-residential investment (in 2017 CAD)

Key model includes industry fixed effects and interaction terms to estimate heterogeneous effects across sectors.

---

## Key Findings

- The tax cut led to a **statistically significant increase (~$980 million)** in investment in Quebec.
- **Manufacturing** showed a more pronounced response than **Finance**, though the industry-differentiated effect was not statistically significant.
- Parallel trends and no-spillover assumptions appear reasonably satisfied, allowing for a causal interpretation.
